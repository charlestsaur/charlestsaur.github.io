# If by Life You Were Deceived

In shadows deep, where truth resides,
If life deceived me, where do I hide?
In echoes of dreams, once so bright,
Now shrouded in the cloak of night.

Promises whispered, illusions spun,
In the web of time, our fates are spun.
If life deceived me, what do I trust?
In the ashes of faith, crumbled to dust.

Through winding paths, I wander lost,
In the labyrinth of memories tossed.
If life deceived me, what did I learn?
In the silence of hearts, where flames still burn.

Yet amidst the chaos, a glimmer shines,
In the depths of despair, hope entwines.
If life deceived me, I’ll still believe,
In the strength of love, that will never leave.

For though the road may twist and bend,
In the realm of dreams, we find our end.
If life deceived me, let truth be known,
In the light of dawn, I’ll stand alone.
