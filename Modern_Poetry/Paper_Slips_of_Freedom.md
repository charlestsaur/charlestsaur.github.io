# Paper Slips of Freedom

Slips of paper, light as air,
Whisper dreams beyond despair.
Folded, crumpled, torn, or free,
Each one holds a piece of me.

Scattered words on fragile skin,
Fleeting thoughts where hope begins.
Set them loose upon the sky,
Watch them dance, watch them fly.

Not confined to lines or chains,
Drifting far through sun and rain.
For freedom lives in every note,
In every word a heart once wrote.
